Source code for a convex surrogate operator for non-modular loss function described in: 

Yu, J. and M. B. Blaschko: A Convex Surrogate Operator for General Non-Modular Loss Functions. AISTATS, 2016

An example implementation is provide in main.m which trains with a non-modular loss function defined in testLossFunc.m

See the comments in each script for details.
